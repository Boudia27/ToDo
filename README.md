This to-do app has a simple, contemporary UI that makes use of Google Fonts for sophisticated typography, Bootstrap for responsive design, and Font Awesome for recognizable images. By selecting from all, completed, or incomplete choices, users can filter activities based on their completion status. They can also add tasks with ease using the input form and view them in a tidy overview. Simple button controls allow you to mark tasks as completed or delete them completely. For a user-friendly task management experience on any device, this program blends style and functionality.
